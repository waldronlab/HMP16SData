# HMP16SData

Raw data from the Human Microbiome Project were processed through the QIIME 
(Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) pipeline and made publicly 
available through the NIH. However, the data are difficult to work with in the 
absence of specialized knowledge of the QIIME software. As such, the HMP16SData 
package intends to make the data easier and more convenient to work with in 
order to enable scientific discovery.
