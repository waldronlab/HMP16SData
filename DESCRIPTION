Description:
    Raw data from the Human Microbiome Project were processed through the QIIME
    (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) pipeline and made publicly
    available through the NIH. However, the data are difficult to work with in
    the absence of specialized knowledge of the QIIME software. As such, the
    HMP16SData package intends to make the data easier and more convenient to
    work with in order to enable scientific discovery.
